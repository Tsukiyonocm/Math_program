# Math_program
1. Create a simple gui to test out. This will likly not be formatted in anyway that looks nice as of now. I just want to set this up in order to test out the functionality from the get go. Once the basic idea is fleshed out, this can be built upon to add addition functionality and overall design to it. 

Needed:
Tkinter
Random
Simple Python

Test Version
------------
0.01 - Created basic project folders. Thats it. Im an over-achiever.
